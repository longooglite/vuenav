# Flexibility

[![NPM Version][npm-img]][npm] [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci]

[Flexibility] is a polyfill for the [Flexible Box Layout], commonly known as Flexbox. With Flexibility, you get to design beautiful, flexible layouts on the web without sacrificing the experience in older Internet Explorer browsers.

Flexbox is used lay out, align, and distribute elements in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. To better understand Flexbox, read [Chris Coyier]â€™s excellent [Complete Guide to Flexbox].

To start using Flexbox in Internet Explorer 8 & 9, download the [flexibility.js] script and include it anywhere on your page.

```html
<script src="flexibility.js"></script>
```

Next, add a `-js-display: flex` declaration before any `display: flex` declarations in your CSS, or use [PostCSS Flexibility] to automate this during your build process.

```css
.container {
	-js-display: flex;
	display: flex;
}
```

[Flexibility] will automatically detect any flex-affected elements on the page and restyle them accordingly in Internet Explorer 8 & 9.
